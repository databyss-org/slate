# Nodes: Editor, Elements and Texts

The most important type are the `Node` objects:

- A root-level `Editor` node that contains their entire document's content.
- Container `Element` nodes which have semantic meaning in your domain.
- And leaf-level `Text` nodes which contain the document's text.

These three interfaces are combined together to form a treeâ€”just like the DOM. For example, here's a simple plaintext value:

```js
const editor = {
  children: [
    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      children: [
        {
          text: 'A line of text!',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  // ...the editor has other properties too.
}
```

Mirroring the DOM as much as possible is one of Slate's principles. People use the DOM to represent documents with richtext-like structures all the time. Mirroring the DOM helps make the library familiar for new users, and it lets us reuse battle-tested patterns without having to reinvent them ourselves.

A Slate document is a nested and recursive structure. In a document, elements can have children nodesâ€”all which may have children nodes without limit. The nested and recursive structure enables you to model simple behaviors such as user mentions and hashtags or complex behaviors such as tables and figures with captions.

## `Editor`

The top-level node in a Slate document is the `Editor` itself. It encapsulates all of the richtext "content" of the document. Its interface is:

```ts
interface Editor {
  children: Node[]
  ...
}
```

We'll cover its functionality later, but the important part as far as nodes are concerned is its `children` property which contains a tree of `Node` objects.

## `Element`

Elements make up the middle layers of a richtext document. They are the nodes that are custom to your own domain. Their interface is:

```ts
interface Element {
  children: Node[]
  [key: string]: any
}
```

You can define custom elements for any type of content you want. For example you might have paragraphs and quotes in your data model which are differentiated by a `type` property:

```js
const paragraph = {
  type: 'paragraph',
  children: [...],
}

const quote = {
  type: 'quote',
  children: [...],
}
```

It's important to note that you can use _any_ custom properties you want. The `type` property in that example isn't something Slate knows or cares about. If you were defining your own "link" nodes, you might have a `url` property:

```js
const link = {
  type: 'link',
  url: 'https://example.com',
  children: [...],
}
```

Or maybe you want to give all of your nodes ID an property:

```js
const paragraph = {
  id: 1,
  type: 'paragraph',
  children: [...],
}
```

All that matters is that elements always have a `children` property.

## Blocks vs. Inlines

Depending on your use case, you might want to define another behavior for `Element` nodes which determines their editing "flow".

All elements default to being "block" elements. They each appear separated by vertical space, and they never run into each other.

But in certain cases, like for links, you might want to make as "inline" flowing elements instead. That way they live at the same level as text nodes, and flow.

> ðŸ¤– This is a concept borrowed from the DOM's behavior, see [Block Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements) and [Inline Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements).

You can define which nodes are treated as inline nodes by overriding the `editor.isInline` function. (By default it always returns `false`.)

Elements can either contain block elements as children. Or they can contain inline elements intermingled with text nodes as children. But elements **cannot** contain some children that are blocks and some that are inlines.

## Voids

Similarly to blocks and inlines, there is another element-specific behavior you can define depending on your use case: their "void"-ness.

Elements default to being non-void, meaning that their children are fully editable as text. But in some cases, like for images, you want to ensure that Slate doesn't treat their content as editable text, but instead as a black box.

> ðŸ¤– This is a concept borrowed from the HTML spec, see [Void Elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html-markup-20110405/syntax.html#void-element).

You can do define which elements are treated as void by overriding the `editor.isVoid` function. (By default it always returns `false`.)

## `Text`

Text nodes are the lowest-level nodes in the tree, containing the text content of the document, along with any formatting. Their interface is:

```ts
interface Text {
  text: string
  [key: string]: any
}
```

For example, a string of bold text:

```js
const text = {
  text: 'A string of bold text',
  bold: true,
}
```

Text nodes too can contain any custom properties you want, and that's how you implement custom formatting like **bold**, _italic_, `code`, etc.

## Keys

All nodes have a `key` that is generated automatically by Slate and used internally to map Slate nodes to DOM nodes. It is also used as the `key` prop on the React element that contains your node's children. 

The `key` is stored in a [WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap), where the map key is the node object from the Editor `value`. This means that the `key` is stable as long as the instance of the node object in `value` remains unchanged.

Because of this, be cautious when using Slate as a controlled input. You should update only the values of the node object, but not the node object instance itself. For example, we cannot manage our state using an [immutable update pattern](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/immutable-update-patterns/) like Redux, which returns a mutated clone as the new state, because then our underlying object instances would always change after an update even if the node data remained constant. This would lead to a lot of unnecesary re-rendering and re-mounting in the DOM, because all of our node keys will change on every render.  

### Overriding keys

If we want to use an immutable update pattern to manage our controlled `value`, we need to make our keys stable across updates by overriding the `editor.getKey` method using the [plugins](/concepts/07-plugins) pattern:

```js
import { createEditor } from 'slate'
import React, { useRef } from 'react'

const nodeKeysRef = useRef({})

const withKeys = editor => {
  const { findKey } = editor
  editor.findKey = element => {
    const { id } = element
    if (!nodeKeysRef.current[id]) {
      nodeKeysRef.current[id] = findKey(element)
    }
    return nodeKeysRef.current[id]
  }
  return editor
}
const editor = withKeys(createEditor())
```

Note that we are now responsible for maintaining our map between `id` strings and `key` objects. For memory efficiency, we should remove the key from our map when we remove a node so that it gets garbage collected correctly. In the example above, this would be achieved by calling `delete` on that map entry, as in:

```js
const removeKey = id => {
  delete nodeKeysRef[id]
}
```
